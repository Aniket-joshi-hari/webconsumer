<h2 style={{fontWeight:'100'}}>Returning/ Cancelling at the time of delivery.</h2>
<p className="paraSize">We make sure all the book are in a reading condition. There are a series of stringent quality checks that are undertaken on every book before delivery. However, if you don’t like the books at the time of delivery, you can return them - there will be no questions asked. If accepted by you or your representative (anyone receiving the order on your behalf) at the time of delivery, the products cannot be returned later. Only books with major defects or non-readability will be taken back. However, some genuine issues can be discussed over a call and we might take items back, but only if pointed out at the time of delivery. Unfortunately, returns cannot be initiated once the delivery is accepted by you or your representatives. To ensure that you face no issues regarding this, Zypher team will leave your premises only when you are satisfied with the order.</p>
